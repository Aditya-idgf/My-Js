    // fetch api was a upgrade to XMLHttpsRequest() providing a better network request than its predecessor 
    // fetch() is method that sends a request over the network to return a promise over which we can decide to resolve or reject the request
    // fetch() gives error only when a network error is encountered.
    // for HTTP errors like 404, they are always counted as response and are not rejected , for this .then() handler must check reponse.status & reponse.ok
